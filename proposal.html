For our final project, we will be creating a map of crime incidents and reports both on campus and just off of campus, where many students reside, for the past year. We will focus on felony offenses (crimes like home burglaries, assaults, violent crimes, and robberies)
We will be obtaining the data from Ohio State (building locations, crime incidents on record), the FBI (crime reports by location), Crime Reports, and The Columbus Dispatch (crime reports). The variety of sources for crime reports will enable us to obtain the most recent and greatest number of reported incidents for the greater OSU geographic area. 
Craig and Katherine will be doing most of the research on the crime reports, organizing the reports by type of crime, date, and location. They will also focus on converting the data into usable material for the webpage. The data will likely be organized through a spreadsheet document. This will make the transition into the map as simple as possible.
Jacob will focus on the coding aspects of the data and organizing the overall layout of the map using HTML coding.
